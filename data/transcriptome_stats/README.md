### Transcriptome Stats
Files presented below represent pre and post-filtering transcriptomes derived from both the vsearch and orthofinder strategy described in [the notebook](https://github.com/alextrouerntrend/fir-transcriptomics/blob/master/notebooks/reference_assembly.ipynb). Here I will describe the file naming scheme.
- "o" refers to orthofinder strategy
- "v" refers to vsearch-only strategy
- "85" refers to vsearch run at 85% identity
- "90" refers to vsearch run at 90% identity
- "filt" suffix refers to sets that have been filtered to meet species membership requirements
